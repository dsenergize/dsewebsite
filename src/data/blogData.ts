      { "type": "paragraph", "text": "Performance Ratio (PR) is one of the most important key performance indicators for a solar power plant.

      { "type": "paragraph", "text": "While the installed capacity (e.g., 1 MW) tells you the potential of a plant, the PR tells you how much of that potential is actually being realized. Factors like high temperatures, soiling, equipment degradation, and downtime can all lower the PR, directly impacting your revenue. Continuous monitoring of PR is essential for identifying and addressing these losses proactively." }
